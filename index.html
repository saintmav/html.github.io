		<h3> "The Black Goats Egg" by Takatsuki Sen </h3>
		 
		<p> Reflects what will happen to Kaneki in future chapters as he is turned into a ghoul and 
		his relationship with Rize. In the story, the son of a murder has to come into terms with 
		his violent instincts as he follows in his mother’s footprints. In Tokyo Ghoul itself, 
		Kaneki eventually has to come to terms with the fact that he has been turned into a ghoul. 
		He fights it in the beginning, not giving into his urges for human meat and avoiding conflict, 
		but he eventually has to accept that he needs to eat something to survive. Even later in the 
		series while being tortured by Jason, Kaneki again fights his violent urges as Rize toys with 
		Kaneki’s consciousness, until he eventually accepts that he is a ghoul and that he will need to 
		fight to survive. The story of an innocent boy giving into his violent impulses in “The Black Goat’s Egg” 
		is practically the same struggle that Kaneki will have to face later on. </p>
		
		<h3> Franz Kafka’s “Die Verwandlung” </h3>
		
		<p> The story clearly draws a parallel to Kaneki, as he begins to transform from man to ghoul. 
		He begins to dislike foods he once liked much like the Gregor Samsa in the story, and Kaneki 
		starts to realize what is happening to his body. </p>
		
		<h3> numbers </h3>
		
		<p> Our first example can be found at the end of Chapter 63, on the full page spread of Kaneki 
		as he loses his mind and gives in to his impulses. On his forearms we can clearly see the number 
		12 in black, which corresponds to “The Hanged Man” in the major arcana. The hanged man represents 
		letting go, reversing, suspending action and sacrificing; all of which are actions Kaneki has to 
		go through with. </p>
		
		<p> Another piece of symbolism found in Tokyo Ghoul is another number, which again corresponds 
		to a specific tarot card. The number 7 is the number of “The Chariot”, symbolizing control, 
		victory, and using your will. It is only fitting that this number would appear in chapter 137, 
		when Kaneki meets Arima of the CCG. Arima is known as the prodigy of the CCG, the single most 
		deadly man in their ranks. He is looked up upon as being their strongest fighter, and is 
		depicted as being stern, disciplined and having complete control of his emotions. 
		All of these are aspects of the chariot, and it represents victory and overcoming 
		opposition through confidence and control.  </p>
